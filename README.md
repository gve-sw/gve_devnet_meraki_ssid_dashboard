Running Podman/Docker container was tested on CentOS/RHEL8 - (optional: replace podman commands with docker).

```
git clone https://github.com/gve-sw/gve_devnet_meraki_ssid_dashboard.git

cd GVE_DevNet_Meraki_SSID_Golden_Config

vi .env

 > Change value of "MERAKI_ORGANIZATION=" to EXACT (Captialization and spaces matter) Organization name.
 > If you have more than one organization, you can use comma separation.
 > Example of comma seperate orgs in .env file. 
 > save changes and close file
 
podman build . -t meraki-ssid-app:1 -f container_file

podman run -dit -p 443:443 IMAGE_ID

```

**Application can be accessed at x.x.x.x, where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the server running podman(Not the container).**

**If running on local machine, default address is https://0.0.0.0**

Running without podman/docker:

```
cd gve_devnet_meraki_ssid_dashboard

vi .env

 > Change value of "MERAKI_ORGANIZATION=" to EXACT (Captialization and spaces matter) Organization name.
 > If you have more than one organization, you can use comma separation.
 > Example of comma seperate orgs in .env file.
